But JSON format is text only, which makes it easy to read and use with any programming language. This blog will introduce you to everything there is to know of JSON likeDask is an open-source Python library that lets you work on arbitrarily large datasets and dramatically increases the speed of your computations.

This article will first address what makes Dask special and then explain in more detail how Dask works. So: what makes Dask special?
